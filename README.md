# 101* Uses For Your Uncle's Broadsword
A game we decided to make for a friend's New Years 2021 game jam! Theme: "One Weapon, Multiple Uses."

Tentatively, the game we're making is a "platformer" where your broadsword is your means of jumping, wall-climbing, fighting....

## Ideas we've come up with
* Throw your sword and have it hang in the air until you let it come back to you, a la Koops in *Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door?* ("Sword suspending.")
  * Caleb's thinking: slash once, then *hold the button* to activate. Intro sword-throwing relatively late in the game, then intro sword-suspending one level *after* so they can get used to the idea first!
  * Can't jump w/o sword. Ergo: level/challenge where you have to balance your suspended sword against pits to jump over? How to do that?
    * Play with how the sword returns to you. Straight line back to where it started, or float magically back to you?
